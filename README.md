# tm - terraforming mars apps
Various projects revolving around the game terraforming mars
Try them at https://sliceofbread.neocities.org/

There are several projects here. At least some of them use common files.
Things are a bit haphazard as I was using these projects to learn HTML/JS

tm.html - electronic board for TM
- Created so we could play TM while travelling and only bring cards.
- Does not enforce rules

automatm.html - same as above but with 'AI' bots that can play
- bots are limited as they don't play cards, added some new rules for them
- intended as a slightly more game-like way of playing solo

tm_crypto.html - supports people who use Play By Forum (PBF) on BGG
- uses crypto to allow a people to play without a trusted third party dealer
- uses the BGG PBF forum for state storage
- this is essentially an implementation of Mental Poker
